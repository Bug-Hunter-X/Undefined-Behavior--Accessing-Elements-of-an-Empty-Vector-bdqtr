This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: accessing elements of an empty vector. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version. The error arises from attempting to iterate through a vector after it has been cleared using `vec.clear()`.  This results in undefined behavior, potentially causing crashes or unexpected outputs.  The solution involves checking the vector's size before iterating.
